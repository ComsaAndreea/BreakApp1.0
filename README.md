# BreakApp1.0
Enjoy your free time with movies and games!

The Break App is a desktop application that offers several areas for leisure: games, music, and movies. The games section consists exclusively of games developed from scratch, including the game Seastone, also developed entirely in C++. This game includes general knowledge questions and shows an animation of a man climbing stairs for each correct answer. Another game, also in C++, features a flag that constantly changes color, and the player must stop on a color combination that matches a real flag to score points. The music section allows the user to search for their favorite music, redirecting them to the songâ€™s page on YouTube. The movies section similarly provides links to the respective movie pages.

Technologies:

C# for the UI, with login and application design
Greenfoot, Java, C++ for the original games
